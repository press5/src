vultr-bwmon - a set of scripts for Nagios to monitor bandwidth on Vultr VPSes

vultr-getbw.pl - gets the bandwidth data from the api
    cron this to run no less than hourly (vultr only updates bandwidth hourly);
    write the output to a file somewhere nagios can read it to get the data
    (like /tmp/vultr.bw) 

nagios-vultr-bwmon.pl - the nagios script itself. 
    arguments: [path to bw file] [server_label] <warn thresh> <crit thresh>
    example: nagios-vultr-bwmon /tmp/vultr.bw fhqwhgads 75 80
    defaults to 80 for warn_thresh and 90 for crit_thresh

Known issues:
  vultr-getbw.pl will throw a JSON error if you forgot to whitelist the IP
  running the script at vultr's website

  nagios-vultr-bwmon.pl does not round the bandwidth percentage, it just truncs
  after two decimal places
