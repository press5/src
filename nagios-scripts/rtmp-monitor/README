This is a quick, simple script I wrote to monitor the status of an nginx-rtmp-module server. 
The module provides a status page, /stats for plain text and /stat for XML. We'll use the XML version.
The only thing you need to edit in rtmpmon.pl is the path to your /stat page, where indicated.
Once you've done that, accessing rtmpmon.pl from your server in a browser you'll
see something like this: 

stream1-publishing
stream2-publishing
stream3- 
stream4-

My example has four streams and only the first two are currently publishing. 

On my webserver, my nrpe_local.cfg uses check_http to grab the status of each stream from rtmpmon.pl:

command[check_rtmp_stream]=/usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_http -H your.com -p 80 -u /rtmpmon.pl -r $ARG1$

On my nagios server, I set up a service for each stream: 

define service{
  use                   generic-service
  host_name             webserver
  service_description   stream_1
  check_command         check_nrpe!check_rtmp_stream!stream1-publishing
}

The nagios check_command argument from check_rtsp is always going to be the name of your stream, 
followed by a dash, followed by the word 'publishing'.
